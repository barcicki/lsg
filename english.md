The Polish Summer Go Camp is one of the biggest go events in Europe. It has quite a different schedule and attractions then the EGC. We organize regular group lessons for dan players, kyu players, beginners, and children. These are usually held in Polish, but especially the dan-level group isn't afraid to switch to English!

The venue is a farm remodelled to a camping, inspired by the "Northern Exposure" TV series. There's a beautiful lake to swim in, forests to stroll in, horses to ride, and beers to drink. You can sleep in a cottage or in your tent. The camp provides a kitchen, a big barn rebuilt to a general meeting place and dancing room, clean toilets, showers, audio and karaoke hardware, parking.
